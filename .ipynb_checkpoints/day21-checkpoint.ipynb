    "The game state before each round is defined by four numbers - the current square and score so far for each player. Notice that if player 1 is on 20 points then she is guaranteed to win in the next round whatever happens. So start with player 1 on 20 points and work backwards through every game state, recording the number of wins for each player from each state. From earlier game states, either one player will win, or after the round the game will be in one of the states already looked at, so we can look up the number of wins. Work all the way back to zero points for each player and then look up the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with my approach is that I always played a full round (player 1 then player 2), but actually if player 1 wins then player 2 doesn't get to play. The impact of this is that player 1's wins are counted 27 times. To solve this I also counted player 2's wins 27 times, then divided the answer by 27 at the end."
